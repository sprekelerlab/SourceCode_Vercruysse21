"Self-organization of a doubly asynchronous irregular network state for spikes and bursts"

The (network) simulations of the spiking neurons are performed by the Brian2 simulator for spiking neural networks. Brian is a simulator that is easy to learn and use, highly flexible and saves the time of processors and scientists. The software package is well documented (https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and can be easily installed (https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html). The code is presented in jupyter notebooks (https://jupyter.org/) which allows interactive computation of the network simulations. Information on how to instal the jupyter Software is available on the Jupyter website (https://jupyter.org/install). 

The code is organised in different notebooks, with each notebook providing the code to reproduce the main publication figures. This includes creating, running, analysing and plotting the network models.Most of the figures involve running a network with synaptic plasticity which may take a while if you use a laptop without sufficient computing power. For this reason we reduced the simulation time and changed the learning rates in some of the networks without qualitatively changing the results. Changes are indicated in the notebook.
